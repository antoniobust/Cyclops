    <issue
        id="Assert"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Assertions are unreliable in Dalvik and unimplemented in ART. Use `BuildConfig.DEBUG` conditional checks instead."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Assertions"
        explanation="Assertions are not checked at runtime. There are ways to request that they be used by Dalvik (`adb shell setprop debug.assert 1`), but note that this is not implemented in ART (the newer runtime), and even in Dalvik the property is ignored in many places and can not be relied upon. Instead, perform conditional checking inside `if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) { }` blocks. That constant is a static final boolean which is true in debug builds and false in release builds, and the Java compiler completely removes all code inside the if-body from the app.&#xA;&#xA;For example, you can replace `assert speed > 0` with `if (BuildConfig.DEBUG &amp;&amp; !(speed > 0)) { throw new AssertionError() }`.&#xA;&#xA;(Note: This lint check does not flag assertions purely asserting nullness or non-nullness; these are typically more intended for tools usage than runtime checks.)"

        summary="Weak RNG"
        explanation="Key generation, signing, encryption, and random number generation may not receive cryptographically strong values due to improper initialization of the underlying PRNG on Android 4.3 and below.&#xA;&#xA;If your application relies on cryptographically secure random number generation you should apply the workaround described in https://android-developers.blogspot.com/2013/08/some-securerandom-thoughts.html .&#xA;&#xA;This lint rule is mostly informational; it does not accurately detect whether cryptographically secure RNG is required, or whether the workaround has already been applied. After reading the blog entry and updating your code if necessary, you can disable this lint issue."
